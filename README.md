### Features Left to Implement

* For improvement of the site, features left to implement include the following: a gallery for further images of attractions/provisions in the local neighbourhood, a transport page for detailed information on local public transport, a live calendar showing the availability of the property along with pricings according to the time of year, social media links, and a reviews page for the user to see what previous visitors had to say about their stay. 

## Testing

## Validator Testing

### HTML

* Initially when passing the index.html (Landing Page) file through the official W3C Validator, it presented some warnings and a couple of errors regarding the code where I had mistakenly not removed elements of code that I had trialled in the development process. Thankfully these were minor and it did not take too much time to correct these and render the document with no errors. 
* When the attractions page was passed through the W3C Validator, there were numerous errors that were flagged due to the presence of span elements where they were not needed, again from previous stages of development. These were easy to rectify and had no impact on the overall rendering of the HTML document once corrected.
* The Bookings page only brought up a warning message due to my form sitting within a section without the presence of a heading. The section was therefore alteres to a div and resolved the issue. 

### CSS

* When passing through the official (Jigsaw) W3C Validator, 2 errors were found; one due to a single occurence of a british spelling of 'center' (centre), and the other due to a mis-application of the use of 'solid' as a value of 'border'. This was easily corrected as the styling had no impact on my chosen styles. 
* No other errors were found, but there was a warning that my font styles could not be checked due to being an import link from Google Fonts. 

## Unfixed Bugs

* There are no bugs left un-fixed as time has been taken to ensure the site runs smoothly.
* The primary shortcoming of this project was that it should have been developed for mobile first which would have made the process of ensuring reponsive design much simpler. However the project was developed for a desktop which meant that CSS media queries were complex to work out in order to make the different features scale down appropriately. As such the CSS code is seemingly large, however all attempts were made to simplify and minimise this as much as possible.
