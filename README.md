# Old Station Way

Old Station Way is a web page advertising a beautiful property to rent in a centralised location in London. The property is targeted towards a large group of people, be it a family or group of friends looking for a comfortable and cosy but stylish "home-away-from-home" when visiting London, UK. This site will be useful for visitors looking for simple property booking with added information on attractions and general things to do during their stay.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

* The fully-functional navigation bar is featured on all 3 pages and includes a link to the Home page, Attractions and Bookings. 
* This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page without needing to use the 'back' button and is labelled to clearly show what information can be found on the other pages, enabling a positive and smooth user experience.

### The Landing Page

* The landing page clearly shows the title of the website to begin with, being the street name of the property, as well as photographs of the rooms purposefully organised to allow the user to see immediately what the decor and size of rooms is like without the need to navigate to another page to see a Gallery. 
* This section includes information about the type of property that they are considering which involves key features that make it stand out from other rentals.

* The Contact Us section is designed to clearly and simply provide contact information for ease of access and speedy communication. 
* Additionally a google map of the property location has been included below the contact information which is fully interactive for the user to be able to review the location of the property, as well as facilities in the vicinity. 
* The user will see the variety of facilities in the immediate area as well as the property's incredibly close proximity to the tube station as well as other transport links.

### Features Left to Implement

* For improvement of the site, I would like to add further pages including the following: a gallery for further images of attractions/provisions in the local neighbourhood, a transport page for detailed information on local public transport, a live calendar showing the availability of the property along with pricings according to the time of year, social media links, and a reviews page for the user to see what previous visitors had to say about their stay.
