                    <p> A 15-minute tube ride from the local tube station you can access Central London, the capital of England
                and the United Kingdom. London is a 21st-century city with history stretching
                back to Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, the iconic ‘Big Ben’ clock
                tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British monarch coronations. Across the Thames River, the London
                Eye observation wheel provides panoramic views of the South Bank cultural complex, and the entire city.

                    <h3>Greg memorial park</h3>
                    <p>A stone's throw from your door lies the beautiful park in memory of the celebrated educator Gregory
                Champkin. Gregory grew up in the countryside town of Stratford-Upon-Avon before moving to London for a
                long-established career in education. He always missed the beautiful greenery his town had to offer and
                as such valued the vibrant various parks that can be found throughout London. This park was founded in
                2020 and named in his honour.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the picturesque trees that line the cobbled pathways, attractions include water activities on
                the natural lake, inclusive of kayaking, paddle boats and rowing. Along the waterfront you can also find
                a series of exquisite restaurants with cuisine varying from italian to japanese.</p>
                    <p>A wonderful day trip with the family.</p>
